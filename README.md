# Stickman-Costume
This was made for a halloween-costume. The code runs on an attiny85, mainly to be able to dim the lights down.

# Usage
- Upload the code to the attiny
- Solder together the board
- Make the costume
- Have fun!
## Operation
- Hold button `SW2` to change brightness/ pwm frequency.
- Click button `SW1` to go through the modes.
## Modes
1) `Static` This is just a static PWM-signal of the set frequency.
2) `Slow Strobe` This is a very slow blinking strobe effect.
3) `Medium Strobe` This is the same strobe effect, just a tad faster.
4) `Fast Strobe` This is the strobe effect in it's full glory!

# Schematic

`R2` and `R3` should be around __1K__.
